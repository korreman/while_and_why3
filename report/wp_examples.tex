\subsection{Loop with addition and subtraction}
This program employs an inefficient approach towards moving a value from \inl{a} to \inl{b},
but it provides a demonstration of
a loop invariant, specified preconditions, assignment, arithmetic, and assertions.
It succeeds on both the Z3 and Alt-Ergo provers.
