In this project, we have built a Why3 plugin for a custom language
using our own syntax tree, parser, and verification condition generator.
Along the way, we have explored the theory of the weakest precondition calculus,
documented the necessary parts of the Why3 API,
and shown process of building plugins for Why3.
The supported language is simple and very limited,
but it showcases the possibilities of using Why3
to work directly with languages besides WhyML and MLCFG.
