# Week 1

## Summary

These first few days, I have:

- Set up a Why3 environment.
- Read sections 1-3,5 of the documentation.
- Followed along the 6 examples shown in section 3.
- Attempted to familiarize myself with the Why3 IDE.

## Goals

The first goal is to become familiar with different input methods for Why3.
With that in mind, the primary tasks in the first week are:

- Go through sections 4,6 to become familiar with the intended workflow and IDE.
- Read section 9.
- Write some proofs of my own using various input methods.

The focus will mostly be on WhyML and MLCFG.
